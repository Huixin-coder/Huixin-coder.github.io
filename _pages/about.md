Hi! I’m Huixin Liu, an 2020/2021 MRes student in Spatial Data Science and Visualisation at University College London in [The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/) and the [The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/). I’m an interdisciplinary researcher by training with a background in the logistics,urban planning and geographic information systems, and I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. My research interests lies on understanding how technology, policy and human behaviour influence the development of cities and their infrastructure, and using this knowledge to provide powerful ways to solve urban problems.

## My work and research

I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My background and history 
I plan to begin my PhD in [The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) this September (2022). I received my Second MRes from CASA, UCL, my first MRes in Design Science at [Beijing Jiaotong university](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) in China and my B.A. in Logistics at [Tianjin University of Technology](https://www.tjut.edu.cn/)in China.
