Abstract: The cemetery crisis is that of man-earth relationship. Beside relying on the resource allocation and the institutional reform, the dynamic role of technology should also be taken into account. Technological innovation can break through the restrictions of land resource on the cemetery development, avoid cultural conflicts, reduce the social costs, and be more sustainable. In the long run, by making use of the driving force of technological innovation to enhance the endowments of land resources, innovate the burial technology, and use the lands intensively, this paper explores the land resource connotatively, which is the most practical path to solve the contradictions in man-earth relationship in cemetery planning and design.
