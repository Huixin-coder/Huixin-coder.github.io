Abstract: The Ebola virus, which first outbreaks in 1976 and has erupted more than ten times so far, is a rare and deadly disease with a high death rate. It keeps raging on the land of Africa until this year and will likely break out again sometime in the future. Researchers from all over the world have the same keen as the local government on seeking effective ways to reduce or prevent the influence of spreading of Ebola to the people. This study introduces an agent-based model to explore the epidemic infectious progression of Ebola virus disease (not the specific kind of Ebola virus). The aims of this study are to explore the role of the human remains in the Ebola infectious progression, and how significant the presence of human remains influences the infectious progression under different environmental conditions (population density, daily death rate and eliminated days).
