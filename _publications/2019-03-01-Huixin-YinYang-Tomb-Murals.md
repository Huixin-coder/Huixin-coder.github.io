Abstract: Due to its unique historical background and humanistic environment, the tomb murals in the Han Dynasty are completely different in color from other eras. This paper constructs a special color concept, namely the color concept of Yin and Yang, through the color application analysis of the tomb murals in the Han Dynasty and its historical and cultural background. Through analysis, this paper draws out the basic color system of the tomb murals in the Han Dynasty, summarizes some color combinations, and validates the application of the yin and yang color concept. And through the further arrangement of the colors in the tomb murals, the loopholes and misunderstandings in the repair and protection of the current Han tomb murals are mapped out, and it is clear that the construction of the yin and yang color view is necessary for a better understanding of the color system and color rules of the tomb murals in the Han Dynasty. Also, the protection and restoration of the Han tomb murals are of instructive significance and strengthen the attention to Chinese material and cultural heritage.
